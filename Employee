/* a.Write an employee class Janitor to accompany the other employees. 
Janitors work twice as many hours (80 hours/week), they make $30,000 ($10,000 less than others), they get half as much vacation (only 5 days), and they have an additional method named clean that prints "Cleaning!." 
Use the super keyword to interact with the Employee superclass as appropriate.  

b. Write an employee class HarvardLawyer to accompany the other employees. 
Harvard lawyers are like normal lawyers, but they make 20% more money than a normal lawyer, they get 3 days more vacation, and they have to fill out four of the lawyer's forms to go on vacation. 
That is, the getVacationForm method should return "pinkpinkpinkpink". (If the normal Lawyer's vacation form ever changed, the HarvardLawyer's should as well. 
For example, if Lawyer's vacation form changed to "red", the HarvardLawyer's should return "redredredred".) 
Use the super keyword to interact with the Employee superclass as appropriate.  

c. Write a client class called EmployeeMain that creates objects of Lawyer, Janitor and HardvardLawyer class in the main method. 
Write a method called printEmployee() that takes an object of Employee as a parameter and prints out salary, hour, vacation days and vacation form for the employee. 
Also call clean() method if you are printing a Janitor object. Call printEmployee() method from main method. */
