 Write an instance method called area that will be placed inside the Rectangle class. The method returns the area of the rectangle.  
 Write another instance method called changeSize that will be placed inside the Rectangle class. This method changes the height and width of the rectangle. 
The method accepts newWidth and newHeight as parameters and changes the value of width and height to this new width and height. 
 Write the client class RectangleClient that creates an object of class Rectangle and initializes its x coordinate, y coordinates, width and height to 5, 12, 4, and 8 respectively. 
Print out the x- coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height (using toString method) and area of this rectangle. Then change the size of this rectangle to width = 3 and height = 10 and then print out the x- coordinate, y-coordinate, width, height area again

public class Rectangle {
	private int x;
	private int y;
	private int width;
	private int height;
public Rectangle (int X, int Y, int w, int h){
	x = X;
	y = Y;
	width = w;
	height = h;
}
public int getX(){
	return x;
}
public int getY(){
	return y;
}
public int getW(){
	return width;
}
public int getH(){
	return height;
}
public String toString(){
	return  "coordinate is (" + x + "," + y +") and demension is " + width + " X " + height + " where " + width + " is width and " + height + " is height";
}
public void area(int width,int height){
	System.out.println("Area is:" + width * height);
}
public void changeSize( int newWidth, int newHeight){
	width = newWidth;
	height = newHeight;
}
	}
//the end


//client class
public class RectangleClient {
	public static void main(String [] args){
		Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(5,12,4,8);
		System.out.println(r1);
		r1.area(4,8);
		r1.changeSize(3,10);
		System.out.println(r1);
		r1.area(3,10);
	}

}
//the end
